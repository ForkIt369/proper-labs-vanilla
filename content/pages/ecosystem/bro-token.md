# $BRO Token

> **The unifying currency that powers the entire Proper Labs ecosystem**

$BRO is designed as a single-token model that unifies identity, culture, and finance across all Proper Labs products, ensuring value capture loops back into the ecosystem rather than fragmenting across multiple assets.

## Token Design Philosophy

**One Token, Many Functions**
$BRO serves multiple roles while maintaining simplicity and value concentration, avoiding the complexity and dilution of multi-token systems.

## Token Economics

### Supply Mechanics
| Component | Allocation | Vesting |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Community Rewards** | 40% | Released over 4 years |
| **Treasury** | 20% | DAO controlled |
| **Team & Advisors** | 15% | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |
| **Investors** | 15% | 2-year vest, 6-month cliff |
| **Liquidity** | 10% | Immediate |

### Distribution Strategy
- **Initial Supply**: 1 billion $BRO
- **Emission Schedule**: Deflationary over time
- **Burn Mechanisms**: Transaction fees, tier upgrades
- **Maximum Supply**: Hard cap enforced

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

### 🔥 Burn Mechanisms
- 1% of all transactions burned
- Tier upgrade fees burned
- Penalty fees from early unstaking
- Quarterly treasury burns based on revenue

### 📈 Demand Drivers
- Brofit yield multipliers require $BRO staking
- Premium features locked behind $BRO holdings
- Governance participation requires minimum balance
- Partner integrations use $BRO for settlements

### 💎 Supply Sinks
- Long-term staking incentives
- Reputation staking (locked for tiers)
