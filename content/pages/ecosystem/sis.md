# SIS (Super Intelligence System)

> **The AI infrastructure backbone powering intelligent experiences across the Proper Labs ecosystem**

SIS develops and orchestrates AI agents for both internal operations and external products, built on a harmonic-mathematical foundation that encodes memory and resonance into system logic.

## Core Architecture

### 🎭 The Codex Layer
A unique harmonic-mathematical foundation based on:
- **24-fold Geometry**: Spatial organization of knowledge
- **Recursive Patterns**: Self-similar information structures
- **Observer Coherence**: Context-aware processing
- **Memory Resonance**: Pattern recognition across time

## Multi-Agent Architecture
