## How We Position Ourselves

### 🏦 Innovation Fund + Network
Proper Labs is structured like a fund and incubator: we launch, acquire, and scale ventures, rather than being a startup ourselves.

### 💼 For Investors
Equity is the core story. Tokens and NFTs are execution and distribution tools for communities, but **serious investors invest into Proper Labs as the umbrella fund**.

### 🤝 For Partners
We are an adaptable innovation network where ecosystems, audiences, and B2B integrations plug in.

### 👥 For Communities
We deliver live products, experiences, and value loops.

## Our Core Principles

**Vision Over Details**
Inspire first, explain later. Not everyone will understand AI or crypto in 20 minutes, but they should feel the big picture.

:::warning
**Never Be a Startup**
We launch, acquire, and incubate startups; we are not one ourselves.

**Create More Value**
Always create more value for others than we take — Proper Labs grows by making every partner, investor, and community stronger.
